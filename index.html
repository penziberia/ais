    <section id="history">
      <h2>History of AI</h2>
      <p>The history of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times, but the modern field began in the mid-20th century:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1950s</strong>: Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test to measure machine intelligence. The term "artificial intelligence" was coined at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956.</li>
        <li><strong>1960s-1970s</strong>: Early AI programs like Eliza and the Logic Theorist were developed. The field faced criticism and funding cuts, leading to the first "AI winter."</li>
        <li><strong>1980s</strong>: The rise of expert systems and neural networks led to renewed interest in AI, but another AI winter followed in the late 1980s.</li>
        <li><strong>1990s-2000s</strong>: Advances in machine learning and the availability of large datasets spurred significant progress in AI applications.</li>
        <li><strong>2010s-present</strong>: Breakthroughs in deep learning and transformer architectures have enabled impressive advancements in natural language processing and computer vision.</li>
      </ul>
